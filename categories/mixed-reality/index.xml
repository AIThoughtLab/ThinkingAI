This technique is highly valuable, particularly when working with limited data, as it enables us to leverage the benefits of a pre-trained Resnet50 network. The UNet is an incredibly popular deep learning architecture for segmentation tasks and has become a go-to solution for many practitioners in this field. If you are interested in learning more about the original 2D UNet paper, I highly recommend referring to the source material.</description></item><item><title>Brain Tumor Detection with U-Net and Immersive Visualization in Mixed Reality Environment</title><link>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/projects/unet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/projects/unet/</guid><description>Problematics
The recent advancement in processing power of computers have enabled tremendous opportunities for the increased use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology in medicine and surgery. The visualization of human organs in the 3D environment takes a central role in the procedure of diagnosis and the follow up treatment of any disease. An automated immersive visualization of a human brain from a sequence of 2D MRI images in the MR environment is necessary not only to detect and classify the nature of tumors but also it helps surgeons to approach the tumor from a virtual perspective and to plan a possible surgery ahead of time.</description></item></channel></rss>
