This is a highly potent framework with the ability to be implemented across a broad range of scientific and technological domains. For those interested in learning more about SAM, please visit the website SAM.
Computer vision has relied heavily on segmentation, the process of identifying which image pixels belong to an object. However, creating an accurate segmentation model for specific tasks usually requires specialized technical experts and large volumes of carefully annotated in-domain data.</description></item></channel></rss>
