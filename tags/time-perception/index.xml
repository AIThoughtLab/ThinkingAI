Humans are accurate at timing sub-second to minute intervals in daily routines, but their experience of time can be biased in different contexts. Traditionally, these biases were explained by the decay of modality-specific representations, changes in the internal clock speed, and memory mixing of different temporal representations. Recently, researchers have used Bayesian inference to analyze contextual calibration and improve performance, but how this links to temporal processing is unclear.</description></item></channel></rss>
