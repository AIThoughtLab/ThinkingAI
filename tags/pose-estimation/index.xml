This blog focuses on performing 3D reconstruction of human poses using multiple views captured by a calibrated system. To achieve this, a deep neural network called OpenPose is used to estimate the location of the joints in the human body. The OpenPose model has been trained to recognize 25 different joints in the human body, such as the head, shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. These joints are critical for determining the posture and movement of a person.</description></item></channel></rss>
