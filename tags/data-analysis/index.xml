Image analysis is a critical step in many research fields, including biology, medicine, and materials science. One widely-used software for image analysis is ImageJ, which is a powerful, user-friendly program developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
ImageJ allows users to analyze digital images by performing a range of quantitative measurements, such as area, intensity, and particle size. It also has a wide variety of image processing and manipulation tools, including filters, segmentation, and thresholding.</description></item></channel></rss>
