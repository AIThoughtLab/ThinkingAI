&amp;ndash;When a system is subject to a periodic forcing with a frequency that is equal to its natural frequency, it results in resonance. In forced oscillation, the frequency of the periodic force is denoted by \(\omega\) while the natural frequency of the system is denoted by \(\omega_{0}\). When \(\omega\) and \(\omega_{0}\) are equal, the amplitude of the oscillation increases significantly, leading to resonance. Resonance can be observed in a variety of physical systems, including mechanical, electrical, and acoustic systems.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian optimization of time perception</title><link>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/posts/bayesianoptimization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/posts/bayesianoptimization/</guid><description>Introduction: Context and Motivation
Humans are accurate at timing sub-second to minute intervals in daily routines, but their experience of time can be biased in different contexts. Traditionally, these biases were explained by the decay of modality-specific representations, changes in the internal clock speed, and memory mixing of different temporal representations. Recently, researchers have used Bayesian inference to analyze contextual calibration and improve performance, but how this links to temporal processing is unclear.</description></item><item><title>Understanding the Dempster-Shafer Theory for Deep Learning</title><link>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/posts/ds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/posts/ds/</guid><description>Introduction
The Dempster-Shafer theory (DST), named after its creators Arthur Dempster and Glenn Shafer, is a powerful mathematical framework for representing and managing uncertain information. It is particularly useful in situations where the available data is incomplete, imprecise, or contradictory. In this post, we will introduce the core concepts of the Dempster-Shafer theory, explore its practical applications in deep learning, and discuss its advantages over traditional probability theory.

The Marching Cube Algorithm is a well known algorithm in computer graphics and scientific visualization for creating a 3D surface mesh from a 3D scalar field. The input of marching cube algorithm is a 3D voxels or 3D coordinate points and the output is a triangular mesh that represents the isosurface of the scalar field.
The basic idea of the algorithm is to divide the input volume into a regular grid of cubes, with each cube having 8 corners.</description></item><item><title>3D UNet for Brain Tumor Segmentation</title><link>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/projects/3d-unet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/projects/3d-unet/</guid><description>In this post we will discuss how to use a 3D UNet to train a deep learning model. 3D UNet is a deep learning technique used for volumetric image segmentation, which is the process of dividing a 3D image into multiple regions or segments based on their characteristics.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) technology plays a vital role in Science and Engineering for immersive visualization and is a new interactive paradigm. The recent advancement in the processing power of computers have enabled tremendous opportunities for the increased use of VR technology in medicine and surgery. Preoperative planning of Catheter Ablation (CA) Therapy in the VR environment is an important immersive application not only to minimize the risk of intricacy during surgery but also to reduce the operating time, a method of training for novice surgeons and for patient education.</description></item><item><title>Brain Tumor Detection with U-Net and Immersive Visualization in Mixed Reality Environment</title><link>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/projects/unet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/projects/unet/</guid><description>Problematics
The recent advancement in processing power of computers have enabled tremendous opportunities for the increased use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology in medicine and surgery. The visualization of human organs in the 3D environment takes a central role in the procedure of diagnosis and the follow up treatment of any disease. An automated immersive visualization of a human brain from a sequence of 2D MRI images in the MR environment is necessary not only to detect and classify the nature of tumors but also it helps surgeons to approach the tumor from a virtual perspective and to plan a possible surgery ahead of time.</description></item><item><title>Human 3D Pose Reconstruction</title><link>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/posts/pose/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/posts/pose/</guid><description>Human 3D Pose Reconstruction
This blog focuses on performing 3D reconstruction of human poses using multiple views captured by a calibrated system. To achieve this, a deep neural network called OpenPose is used to estimate the location of the joints in the human body. The OpenPose model has been trained to recognize 25 different joints in the human body, such as the head, shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. These joints are critical for determining the posture and movement of a person.</description></item><item><title>Choregraphe Software for Pepper Robot</title><link>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/posts/choregraphe/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/posts/choregraphe/</guid><description>The purpose of this post is to build up a robot speaking system with body language and speech text and speech sound in Choregraphe.

Before we start the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) optimization algorithm, we first see what is Gradient Decent (GD) optimization and how it works and then discuss about Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and finally Adam optimization.
Gradient Decent (GD)
GD is one of the most well known optimization algorithm available in machine learning and deep learning framework. Lets say we have a scalar cost function C which is continuous in the domain \(R_n\) (n-dimensional real vector space), takes the input vector \(x ( = x_1, x_2 &amp;hellip; x_n)\) of length \(n\) and we would like to find an optimal value of this cost function.</description></item><item><title>Keras â High Level API</title><link>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/posts/kerasapi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AIThoughtLab.github.io/ThinkingAI/posts/kerasapi/</guid><description>What is Keras?
