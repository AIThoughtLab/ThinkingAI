I am a highly motivated and dedicated professional with a strong background in physics and a passion for artificial intelligence and virtual reality. I hold a Master's degree in Physics, and my interest in deep learning and machine learning led me to pursue another Master's degree in AI. I am a lifelong learner and I am always eager to acquire new knowledge and skills.

After completing my Master's in AI, I decided to further my education and pursued another Master's degree in VR. This has allowed me to combine my passion for AI with my interest in VR and create innovative solutions.

I am a curious and inquisitive person, always eager to explore new ideas and technologies. I am a strong believer in the power of education and lifelong learning, and I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
